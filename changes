2 Api endpoint result show 400 badrequest mensages with the word case correcty. There is situations when the attribute name is showing diferents word case
Examples: 

Wrong ->  BadRequest 400 The Email is required.
OK    ->  BadRequest 400 The email is required.

1.2 Standardize the GET queries from the GET request so that the login attribute names have similar nomenclatures;
For exemple: GET query name today -> token, correctily -> refreshToken (like the login body attribute)

3 Create a new attribute in the return API, showing the something like as "userMessage". So that, this is distinct with the current "message" because it is so tecnical info about the HTTP result.

1.1. Create on the table Users the column "AlwaysLoginWith2StepAuth"

1. Check priority the undefined after run application

** security: implement validation to count wrong tried log in to prevent robots requests.

** generate keys to cripty the tokens and codes info, every client app need to know about your own cript secret key

* why refresh token is inserting two lines in database?

* login without password (login with email and code numbers)

* improve the refreshtoken process login with a 'count' sequence to turn it more hard to intercept by hackers access

** google login we need to update the user too, not only create

** encript operations around the code, become to use the passwordEncryptServe


_________________________

OK DONE *** security -> check if the loginWithCode is the refresh or otp token, because can the bad user try to login with a different token
    * do it for all endpoints, maybe we needs an enum to map all possibilities

OK DONE *** google callback today that is return the refreshtoken, change to return userinfotoken
** OK DONE (THERE IS NOT DEFAULT-LANGUAGE PROVIDER BY GOOGLE USER INFO ENDPOINT) OAUTH GOOGLE DEFAULT LANGUAGE SAVE
* OK DONE result json esta campos bit deve ser boolean a apresentação
* OK DONE pensar como a aplicação irá obter o contexto inicial ao abrir o identityserver. provavelmente usando uma conta super usuario
* OK DONE revisar todos os metodos novos
